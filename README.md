# Smart Fridge - Engineering thesis project

Smart Fridge is a web application that helps users search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. It was developed using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The Spoonacular API is used to find ingredient-based recipes, while the Twilio API allows users to send a shopping list of missing ingredients to their phone. Users have the option to log in, create a new account, or continue as a guest. If they choose to continue as a guest, they can log in or sign up later using a modal window. Once logged in, users can access their saved recipes, search results, and the log out option. Users and guests can search for recipes using the provided ingredients, and the app will fetch data from the backend and the Spoonacular API to return the best matching recipes. Users can also save recipes and send a shopping list to their phone, but guests will need to log in or create an account to do so. Users can also remove saved recipes from their list.
